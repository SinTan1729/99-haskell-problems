## Solutions to H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems

I'm learning Haskell. So, I decided to solve the problems listed
[here](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems) for
practicing.

I'm using the great book Learn You a Haskell for Great Good by Miran Lipovaƒça
(and now maintained by the community) available to read for free
[here](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/). I'll recommend it highly if anyone
else decides to embark of this journey.
